# About this project
## The Origin
The whole thing origins from the spring of 2016 on a course of database. Students are required by their professor to build this action tracking system based on MySQL. However, the project failed in the end for some reasons. Later, I felt it's pity to abandon this half-finished project. So I tried to restart it by myself.
